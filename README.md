# first-ml-project-usahousing
This repository contains the code and resources for 'USA Housing Price predictor'. It is a model built on Linear Regression module. The goal of this project was to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate housing prices based on various features such as house age, number of rooms, etc. 
The dataset is obtained from the Kaggle website which is an opensource. It contains some features of typical house, areas, prices and address.
From the dataset address column is dropped inorder to construct heatmap since the elemnts of address column are strings.
Further, pairplot is plotted to visualize all possible columns of the dataset.
Then, from the information available in the dataset, a model is created to predict the price. The model is created by splitting the given data into training data to train the model and testing data to test the trained model.
Finally, A house predictor model is created using the data from the USA Housing.
